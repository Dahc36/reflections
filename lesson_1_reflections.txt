How did viewing a diff between two versions 
of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It showed me all the differences between the files, 
so finding the bug was easy.

How could having easy access to the entire history 
of a file make you a more efficient programmer in 
the long term?
It would make the process of debugging quicker.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually 
choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pro: Each commit has a logical purpose and sense.
Con: Depends on the user to manually save.
